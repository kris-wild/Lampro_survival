<H3>Toolbox: enzyme</H3>

Compares enzyme performance in reactions between two
complementary compounds

<P>
Demo that runs:

 The models account for the enzyme-mediated transformation 
   <I>1A + 1B -> 1C</I>, using<BR>
   1 standard enzyme kinetics: reversible binding of substrates to enzyme<BR>
   2 special case: Synthezing Unit (irreversible binding)<BR>
   3 special case: Rejection Unit (association as well as dissociation rates
     very large)

<P>
 The enzyme can bind two substrates in a reversible way, without
 producing a product, but if both substrates are bound, it can produce
 a product. We assume that the product concentration does not affect
 the transformation rate.

<P>
 For the more general transformation <I>n<FONT
 SIZE=-1><SUB>A</SUB></FONT> A + n<FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>B</SUB></FONT> B
 -> n<FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>C</SUB></FONT> C</I>, the number of parameters
 of the transformation becomes excessive; there is a need for
 simplification.

<P>
 A popular symplification is to let the assocation and dissociation
 rates between substrates and enzyme go to infinity, such that their
 ratios remain bounded. This results in a product of two hyperbolic
 terms for the production rate: the Rejection Unit (RU). This
 representation suffers from several theoretical problems.

<P>
 An attractive alternative is to let the dissociation rates between
 substrates and enzyme go to zero: the Synthesizing Unit (SU). It
 allows a reformulation of the process in terms of fluxes, that can be
 applied in spatially structured environments (such as the living
 cell), where the concept `concentration' becomes problematic. It also
 allows a fully stochastic approach for describing the
 transformation. The DEB theory uses the SU as a module at several
 places.

<P>
 The theory behind SU kinetics is given in:<BR>

Set the parameters by editing file <code>pars_enzyme.m</code> in toolbox enzyme.

Contours are shown for the production rate of compound C as function
of the substrate concentrations A and B, given that these are constant.
See page 42 ff of the DEB-book.

<P>Example of use after editing file <code>pars_enzyme.m</code> in domain enzyme:
<CODE>clear all; pars_enzyme; shcontsu</CODE>.
The command <CODE>clear; pars_enzyme; shcontsu (2)</CODE> gives figure 2 only.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="shbatch">shbatch</A></H4>

Concentration profiles are shown for product C and substrates A and
B in a batch reactor. The initial conditions, and the observation
period can be changed by editing file <code>shbatch.m</code>.

<H4><A NAME="su11">su11, ru11, enz11</A></H4>

The command <CODE>[J_C, fractions] = su11(2.5, 3.1)</CODE> assigns the
flux of product to <CODE>J_C</CODE> and the fractions of bounded
enzyme (.., A., .B, AB; the dot standing for free) to
<CODE>fractions</CODE>, for concentration of substrate A = 2.5, and
that of B = 3.1. This is the SU-case, ru11 and enz11 work in a similar
way for the RU and the reversible enzyme case.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="su">su</A></H4>

The command <CODE>J_C = su(2.5, 3.1, 2, 3)</CODE> assigns the flux of
product to <CODE>J_C</CODE>, for concentration of substrate A = 2.5,
and that of B = 3.1, given the reaction <I>2 A + 3 B -> C</I>.
