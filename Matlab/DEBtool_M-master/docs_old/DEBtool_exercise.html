<H1>DEBtool exercise</H1>

  <P ALIGN="center"> 
  by <A HREF="mailto:bas@bio.vu.nl">Bas Kooijman</A>, 1 Nov 2009


<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

  Open the DEBtool manual <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index.html"><code>index.html</code></A> in the subdirectory <code>manual</code> of DEBtool with some browser (e.g. Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla). 
  If you can read this page you probably already opened it with such a browser; 
  open the manual in a new window to see the exercise and the manual simultaneously. 
  Read the sections on <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool.html#Use"> Use & recommendations</A> and <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool.html#Nomenclature"> Nomenclature</A> of the first page of the DEBtool manual. 
  Click on <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index_contents.html"> Contents</A> to see the various toolboxes (subdirectories) of DEBtool. 
  Visit the <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index_first.html"> Octave intro</A> pages briefly, to know that they offer you a fast introduction to the computer language Octave (or Matlab). 
  It will not be necessary to know anything about Octave in this exercise, but you should be able to change files with an editor that is able to read and
write plain ascii files (e.g. Notepath or Word under Windows, or Emacs; 
  it is essential that the editor does not insert hidden non-ascii characters, which e.g. Word easily does without notice;
  Windows can suppress extensions of file names; 
  Octave can only handle file names with extension .m). 
  In the case that you plan to use Emacs as a text editor (and run Octave under Emacs) a brief visit to <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index_first_e.html"> Emacs intro</A> might be useful. 
  Links to the  manuals of Octave, Gnuplot and Emacs are included in the DEBtool package (these manuals are big).

  <P>
  Start Octave now. 
  A window should open. 
  Test the correct response by Octave by typing <code>1 + 2</code> (followed by the <code>enter</code> key, as allways after a command); 
  Octave should respond with an answer. 
  Try the arrow-keys to regenerate your earlier command, change it and repeat your command.

  <P>
  Check with <code>pwd</code> that Octave has been started in the directory DEBtool. 
  Octave replies with showing the path. 
  If Octave is in a different directory, go to the DEBtool directory using <code>cd pathname</code>, where <code>pathname</code> stands for the path to
DEBtool. 
  The command <code>ls</code> lists the files and subdirectories of DEBtool; 
  you should recognize the names that are listed in the contents.

<H2><A NAME="animal">Animal</A></H2>

  Click on <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index_contents.html"> Contents</A> in the DEBtool manual, and go to <A TARGET="_top" HREF="index_animal.html"> animal</A>. 
  Now go to the animal subdirectory in the Octave window with <code>cd animal</code>. 
  Now open the file <code>pars_animal.m</code> of the subdirectory animal with some text editor.

  <P>
  The parameter file <code>pars_animal.m</code> of animal show a large number of parameters with a short description of each. 
  Any particular function that uses a small number of parameters only. 
  DEBtool allows you to specify parameter values at a certain temperature, and evaluate properties of energetics at another temperature. 
  The first set of parameters are used to do this translation; 
  as long as the value to T equals that of T<sub>1</sub>, the other temperature parameters are not relevant.  
  The second set of parameters are on the chemical composition of the main variables, which are necessary e.g. for specifying mineral fluxes. 
  The next set of parameters link volumes, weights and energies to each other. 
  Notice that <b>structure's molar density</b> [M<sub>V</sub>] = d<sub>V</sub>/ w<sub>V</sub>, while <b>structure's density</b> d<sub>V</sub> is a parameter (weight per volume), and <b>structure's molecular weight</b> w<sub>V</sub> is given by the elemental composition. 
  The last two sets of parameters have no influence on what the organism is doing, but do affect the behaviour of measurements. 
  The last set of 14 parameters directly affect the metabolic behaviour of the organism.

  <P>
  The chosen parametrization for animal's metabolic behaviour avoids to deal with surface areas directly, while food uptake is coupled to the surface area. 
  The reason is to make the parameters for isomorphs better comparable with those for V1-morphs. 
  The following relationships might clarify the links between parameters:
  <ul>
   <li> <b>max mol-specific food uptake rate</b> 
        j<sub>XAm</sub> = {J<sub>XAm</sub>}/ ([M<sub>V</sub>] L<sub>d</sub>); 
        dim(j<sub>XAm</sub>) = mol of food (mol of structure * time)<sup>-1</sup> </li>
   <li> <b>max mol-specific reserve in moles</b> 
        m<sub>Em</sub> = [M<sub>Em</sub>]/ [M<sub>V</sub>]; 
        dim(m<sub>Em</sub>) =  mol of reserve (mol of structure)<sup>-1</sup> </li> 
   <li> <b>energy conductance</b>
        v = y<sub>EX</sub> {J<sub>XAm</sub>}/ [M<sub>Em</sub>] = {J<sub>EAm</sub>}/ [M<sub>Em</sub>]; 
        dim(v) = length of structure * time<sup>-1</sup> </li>
  </ul>
  From these parameters, the following compound parameters are obtained in the routine <code>parscomp</code>, which is called from <code>pars_animal</code>.
  <ul>
    <li> <b>characteristic length</b>
         L<sub>d</sub> = v m<sub>Em</sub>/ (y<sub>EX</sub> j<sub>XAm</sub>); 
         dim(L<sub>d</sub>) = length of structure </li>
    <li> <b> structural lenght at birth</b>
         L<sub>b</sub> = 
         (M<sub>Vb</sub> w<sub>O</sub>(2)/ d<sub>O</sub>(2))<sup>1/3</sup>;
         dim(L<sub>b</sub>) = length of structure </li>
    <li> <b> structural length at puberty</b>
         L<sub>p</sub> = (M<sub>Vp</sub> w<sub>O</sub>(2)/ d<sub>O</sub>(2))<sup>1/3</sup>;
         dim(L<sub>p</sub>) = length of structure </li>
    <li> <b> maximum structural length</b>
         L<sub>m</sub> = v/ (k<sub>M</sub> g); 
         dim(L<sub>m</sub>) = length of structure </li>
    <li> <b>max surface area-specific food uptake rate</b>
         {J<sub>XAm</sub>} = j<sub>XAm</sub> L<sub>d</sub> [M<sub>V</sub>] = [M<sub>V</sub>] v m<sub>Em</sub>/ y<sub>EX</sub>; 
         dim({J<sub>XAm</sub>})= mol of food * time<sup>-1</sup> * length of structure<sup>-2</sup> </li>
    <li> <b>max volume-specific reserve in moles</b>
         [M<sub>Em</sub>] = [M<sub>V</sub>] m<sub>Em</sub>; 
         dim([M<sub>Em</sub>]) = mol of reserve (volume of structure)<sup>-1</sup> </li> 
  </ul>
  The <b>maintenance rate coefficient</b> k<sub>M</sub> = j<sub>EM</sub>/ y<sub>EV</sub> equals the <b>specific maintenance costs</b> j<sub>EM</sub> relative to the <b>growth costs</b> y<sub>EV</sub>; 
  dim(k<sub>E</sub>) = time<sup>-1</sup>.

  <P>
  Read what the function <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_animal.html#animal"><code>animal</code></A> should be doing in the manual and type <code>animal</code>; 
  given some patience, you will see a window that is opened automatically by Gnuplot, that show you the various aspects of animal energetics. 
  By typing some character, for instance a space, you go from one set of graphs in the gnuplot window to the next set. 
  So you can take your time looking at the various graphs. Select the "full screen" option to maximize the size of the windows; 
  some graphs will still be small.

<H2><A NAME="heating">Effect of heating</A></H2>

<H4> On growth of length</H4>

  Search for <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_animal.html#shtime2length"><code>shtime2length</code></A> in the DEBtool manual and read the description. 
  Type <code>pars_animal; shtime2length</code>, and you will see one of the graphs you already saw after typing <code>animal</code> in the introductory
paragraph of this excersize. Search for parameter <code>L_T</code> in the file <code>pars_animal.m</code> and change the value 0 by 0.1. 
  Think about what effect this should have on the growth of body length. 
  Save the file;
  if saving gives problems, change the properties of the file, it is possibly stored as "read only" (under Windows: click on the file with the right-hand button of the mouse, and go to properties). 
  Now type <code>pars_animal; shtime2length</code> to see the effects of an increase in the heating costs.

<H4> On growth flux</H4>

  Search for <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_animal.html#shflux"><code>shflux</code></A> in the DEBtool manual and read the description. 
  Type <code>pars_animal; shflux</code>, and you will see one of the windows you already saw after typing <code>animal</code> in the introductory paragraph of this exercise. 
  Type <code>pars_animal; shflux(2)</code> to see the growth flux as a function of the scaled length, and on full screen. 
  Search for parameter <code>L_T</code> in the file <code>pars_animal.m</code> and change the value 0 by 0.1. 
  Think about what effect this should have on the growth flux. Save the file. 
  Now type <code>pars_animal; shflux(2)</code> to see the effects of an increase in the heating costs. 
  Change the value of <code>L_T</code> back to zero.

<H4> On scaling of respiration with body weight</H4>

  Search for <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_animal.html#shscale"><code>shscale</code></A> in the DEBtool manual and read the description. 
  Type <code>pars_animal; shscale</code>, and you will see one of the windows you already saw after typing <code>animal</code> in the introductory paragraph of this excersize. 
  Type <code>pars_animal; shscale(3)</code> to see the scaling of dioxygen consumption with body weight only, and on full screen. 
  Search for parameter <code>L_T</code> in the file <code>pars_animal.m</code> and change the value 0 by 0.1. 
  Think about what effect this should have on the scaling of dioxygen consumption with body weight. 
  Save the file. 
  Now type <code>pars_animal; shscale(3)</code> to see the effects of an increase in the heating costs.

  <P>
  You can change other parameters as well, of course. 
  Do not forget to run <code>pars_animal</code> after changing a parameter value. 
  It is easy to use parameter values that have no physiological meaning, and DEBtool does not check the values. 
  If you want to memorise the old values, duplicate the line you want to change first and change the value in the second line. 
  Delete double lines when done. 
  Consider the use of <code>clear</code> regularly to make sure that values of variables are used that escape your notice.

<H2><A NAME="maint">Maintenance rate coefficient from growth curves</A></H2>

  Suppose that for three constant food densities, we found for the body length of an isomorph as function of time the following data
  <table align ="center" >
    <tr>
      <th> time in weeks</th>
      <th> 0 </th>
      <th> 1 </th>
      <th> 2 </th>
      <th> 3 </th>
      <th> 4 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th> first series in cm</th> 
      <td> 1 </td> 
      <td> 2 </td>
      <td> 2.5 </td>
      <td> 2.8 </td>
      <td> 2.9 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th> second series in cm</th>
      <td> 1 </td>
      <td> 2.3 </td>
      <td> 3 </td>
      <td> 3.5 </td>
      <td> 3.7 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <th> third series in cm</th>
      <td> 1 </td>
      <td> 2.5 </td>
      <td> 3.5 </td>
      <td> 4.1 </td>
      <td> 4.4 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  We failed to measure the food densities and the types of food differed in the three cases. 
  Find an estimate for the maintenance rate coefficient, and its standard deviation on the assumption that the scatter is normally distributed with a constant variance. 
  Compare the result using the assumption that the variance of the scatter is proportional to the squared mean. Check your results graphically.
  Is the type of food relevant for the problem? 
  Hints:
  <ul> 
    <li> The DEB theory implies that, at constant food density, the length of an isomorph follows a von Bertalanffy growth curve
         L(t) = L<sub>i</sub> - (L<sub>i</sub> - L<sub>b</sub>) e<sup>-r<sub>B</sub>t</sup>.  
         The DEB theory states that the von Bertalanffy growth rate equals 
         r<sub>B</sub> = (3/k<sub>M</sub> + 3d<sub>M</sub>L<sub>i</sub>/ v)<sup>-1</sup>, 
         where 
         k<sub>M</sub> is the rate coefficient, 
         d<sub>M</sub> the shape coefficient, 
         v the energy conductance, 
         L<sub>b</sub> the length at birth, 
         L<sub>i</sub> the ultimate length, 
         t the time. </li>
    <li> use function 
         <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_lib_regr.html#nrregr"><code>nrregr</code></A> or 
         <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_lib_regr.html#nmregr"><code>nmregr</code></A>
         for standard multi-sample regression, function 
         <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_lib_regr.html#pregr"><code>pregr</code></A> for the standard deviation, function 
         <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_lib_regr.html#shregr"><code>shregr</code></A> with the all-in-one option for graphical checking, function 
         <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_lib_regr.html#nmvcregr"><code>nmvcregr</code></A> for regression with constant variation coefficient. </li>
    <li> copy and modify file <code>mydata_regr.m</code> in subdirectory <code>lib/regr</code> for a rapid solution of the problem. 
         This script-file first illustrates how to fit a single model to a single data set, then how to fit two models to two data sets. 
         We here need three models for three data sets, all three similar to the second model, but the von Bertalanffy growth rates of the three sets are now linked. </li>
    <li> realize that we have to fit 6 parameters to the three growth curves: 
         L<sub>b</sub>, L<sub>i,1</sub>, L<sub>i,2</sub>, L<sub>i,3</sub>, k<sub>M</sub>, v/d<sub>M</sub>. 
         Since v and d<sub>M</sub> only occur in combination, these data do not contain information on the two parameters separately, only on the ratio. 
         Also realize that we need three data files to run the regression functions. 
         One way to do this is to create a single data set first, with the name <code>data</code> with time in column 1, and the three series of lengths in columns 2, 3 and 4. 
         Then use <code>data(:,[1 2]),data(:,[1 3]),data(:,[1 4])</code> in the call to the regression routines.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If these hints are not sufficient, look at file <code>lib/regr/mydata_regr_2.m</code> to see the answer. 

  <p>
  This example illustrates that DEB theory allows us to extract information from a combination of data sets, which is not contained in any data set separately. 
  The von Bertalanffy has three parameters. 
  If the data sets have no relationships with each other, we would need 9 parameters; 
  if all initial lengths are equal, we would have 7 parameters. 
  DEB theory implies a link between the data sets, which reduces the number of parameters to 6, with a special meaning. 
  Notice that lack of knowledge on the feeding levels makes that we are dealing here with a collection of length-time curves rather than a surface. 
  If the scaled functional response f has been measured, and DEB theory tells us that L<sub>i</sub> = f L<sub>m</sub>, we would have length as a functon of time and scaled functional response with 4 parameters:
  L<sub>b</sub>, L<sub>m</sub>, k<sub>M</sub>, v/d<sub>M</sub>.

<H2><A NAME="alga">Alga</A></H2>

  Go to the alga subdirectory with <code>cd ../alga</code> and open the file <code>alga/pars_alga.m</code> with some text editor.

  <P>
  The parameter file <code>pars_alga.m</code> gives a short description of each parameter for a 2 reserve 1 structure alga that lives of ammonia and phosphate in a generalized chemostat. 
  The first set of parameters are used to do temperature translations, like in <code>animal</code>; 
  as long as the value to T equals that of T_1, the other temperature parameters are not relevant. 
  The second set of parameters are on the chemical composition of the main variables, which are necessary e.g. for specifying mineral fluxes. 
  The third set of parameters directly affect the metabolic behaviour of the organism, while the last set specifies the local environment of the chemostat. 
  If all specific draining rates are set equal to the specific supply rate, the generalized chemostat is a standard one.

  <P>
  Read what the function <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_alga.html#alga"><code>alga</code></A> should be doing in the manual and type <code>alga</code>. 
  Let us focus on the steady states of a chemostat, where excreted reserves can be re-used. 
  Read the manual on <A TARGET="main" HREF="DEBtool_alga.html#shchem1"><code>shchem1</code></A> and run <code>shchem1</code>.

  <P>
  Change now, in the file <code>pars_alga.m</code>, the fractions <code>kap_EN</code> and <code>kap_EP</code> of not-used reserves that are returned to the reserves and set them to zero. 
  Think about what effect this would have on the reserve densities. 
  Check your ideas against the actual effects by running <code>pars_alga; shchem1(5)</code>. 
  Now change the concentrations of ammonia <code>X_Nr</code> and phospate <code>X_Pr</code> in the supply to the chemostat, and try to predict the effect before you re-run <code>pars_alga; shchem1</code>.
